# TODO

### Do it now!

- Make stack be implemented like `foo = push(foo, bar);` and
  `foo = pop(foo, &bar);` (bar is first value to push, then place to put it).
- Test number validity with a regex.
- Actual math.
- Tab mode switching.
- Fix user-constants (e.g. `23.2.`).
- Update scicalc documentation file.

### Maybe later...

- Unit conversion interface (e.g. from `mol` to `liters`), with drawing of the
  dimensional analysis bars and correct units. Maybe expand to generic problems
  like stoichiometry given a balanced equation, reagents, and desired output.
- Menu system for data in infowin.
- Make the interface clickable (menus and click-number-entry);
- User-variables or scratch stack (to store values).
- History with up/down arrows.
