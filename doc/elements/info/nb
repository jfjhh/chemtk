Niobium

Symbol:   Nb
Relative atomic mass: 92.90638 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 41
Group numbers: 5
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1801 Charles Hatchett (GB)

Niobium was discovered by Charles Hatchett (GB) in 1801. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'Niobe' meaning 'daughter of Tantalus' in Greek
mythology (tantalum is closely related to niobium in the periodic table). It is
a shiny white, soft, ductile metal. Exposed surfaces form oxide film. Niobium
occurs in a mineral columbite. It is used in stainless steel alloys for nuclear
reactors, jets and missiles. It is used as an alloy with iron and nickel. It
can be used in nuclear reactors and is known to be superconductive when alloyed
with tin, aluminium or zirconium.
