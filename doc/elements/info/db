Dubnium

Symbol:   Db
Relative atomic mass: [268]
Atomic number: 105
Group numbers: 5
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1967 Albert Ghiorso & Berkely Lab. (US), Georgy Nikolaevich Flerov & JINR Dubna (RU)

Dubnium was discovered by workers at the Nuclear Institute at Dubna (RU) and by
workers at the University of California, Berkeley (US) in 1967. The origin of
the name dubnium is the Joint Nuclear Institute at 'Dubna', Russia, an
institute heavily involved in the search for heavy elements. It is a synthetic
radioactive metal. Dubnium was made by bombarding californium-249 with a beam
of nitrogen-15 ions. There are now five known isotopes of dubnium. The
longest-lived is dubnium-262, with a half-life of 34 seconds.
