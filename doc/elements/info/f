Atomic number: 9
Group numbers: 17
Period: 2
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1886 Henri Moissan (FR)

Fluorine was discovered by Henri Moissan (FR) in 1886. The origin of the name
comes from the Latin word 'fluere' meaning 'to flow'. It is a pale yellow to
greenish gas, with an irritating pungent odour. Fluorine is a extremely
reactive, flammable gas. It reacts violently with many materials. It is toxic
by inhalation or ingestion. Fluorine doesn't occur elementary in nature.
Fluorine is found in minerals: fluorite (CaF2) and cryolite (Na3AlF6).
Electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid (HF) or potassium acid fluoride (KHF2) is the
only practical method of commercial production. It is used in refrigerants,
other fluorocarbons and in toothpaste as sodium fluoride (NaF).
