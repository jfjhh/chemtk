Lutetium

Symbol:   Lu
Relative atomic mass: 174.967 +- 0.001
Atomic number: 71
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1907 Georges Urbain (FR); Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT)

Lutetium was discovered by Georges Urbain (FR) and independently by Carl
Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT) in 1907. The origin of the name comes from the
Greek word 'Lutetia' meaning 'Paris'. It is a silvery-white and relatively
stable in air, rare earth metal. Lutetium is found with ytterbium in gadolinite
and xenotime. Stable lutetium nuclides can be used as catalysts in cracking,
alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization.
