Atomic number: 56
Group numbers: 2
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1808 Sir Humphry Davy (GB)

Barium was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) in 1808. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'barys' meaning 'heavy'. It is a soft, slightly
malleable, silvery-white metal. Barium oxidises in air and reacts with water.
Soluble compounds are toxic by ingestion. Barium is found in barytine (BaSO4)
and witherite (BaCO3), it is never found in pure form due to its reactivity.
Barium must be stored under kerosene to remain pure. Barite, or barium sulfate
(BaSO4) is used as a filter for rubber, plastics and resins. It is insoluble in
water and so is used in X-rays of the digestive system. Barium nitrate, Ba(NO3)
2, burns brilliant green and is used in fireworks.
