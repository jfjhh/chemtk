Discovery: 1801 Andres Manuel del Rio (MX)

Vanadium was discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio (MX) in 1801 and rediscovered
by Nils Gabriel Sefstrom (SE) in 1830. Named after 'Vanadis', the goddess of
beauty in Scandinavian mythology. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal,
resistant to corrosion by moisture, air and most acids and alkalis at room
temperature. Exposed surfaces form oxide coating. It reacts with concentrated
acids. Vanadium is found in the minerals patronite (VS4), vanadinite [Pb5(VO4)
3Cl] and carnotite [K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.3H2O]. Pure metal produced by heating with C
and Cl to produce VCl3 which is heated with Mg in Ar atmosphere. It is mixed
with other metals to make very strong and durable alloys. Vanadium pentoxide
(V2O5) is used as a catalyst, dye and fixer-fixer.
