Discovery: 1826 Antoine-Jerome Balard (FR)

Bromine was discovered by Antoine-Jerome Balard (FR) in 1826. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'bromos' meaning 'stench'. It is a reddish-brown
liquid with suffocating, irritating fumes that gives off poisonous vapour. It
is a oxidizer that causes severe burns. Bromine occurs in compounds in sea
water. It was once used in large quantities to make a compound that removed
lead compound build up in engines burning leaded gasoline. Now it is primarily
used in dyes, disinfectants and photographic chemicals.
