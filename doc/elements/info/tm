Thulium

Symbol:   Tm
Relative atomic mass: 168.93421 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 69
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1879 Per Theodor Cleve (SE)

Thulium was discovered by Per Theodore Cleve (SE) in 1879. Named after 'Thule',
an ancient name for Scandinavia. It is a soft, malleable, ductile, silvery
metal that tarnishes in air and reacts with water. Thulium dust is flammable.
Thulium is found with other rare earths in the minerals gadolinite, euxenite,
xenotime and monazite. Radioactive thulium is used to power portable x-ray
machines, eliminating the need for electrical equipment.
