Fermium

Symbol:   Fm
Relative atomic mass: [257]
Atomic number: 100
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1953 Albert Ghiorso & Berkely Lab. (US)

Fermium was discovered by Albert Ghiorso & Berkely Lab. (US) in 1953. Named in
honour of Enrico 'Fermi'. It is a synthetic radioactive metal. Fermium was
produced by bombarding lighter transuranium elements with still lighter
particles or by neutron capture.
