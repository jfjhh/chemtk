Krypton

Symbol:   Kr
Relative atomic mass: 83.798 +- 0.002
Atomic number: 36
Group numbers: 18
Period: 4
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1898 Sir William Ramsay, Morris William Travers (GB)

Krypton was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Morris William Travers (GB) in
1898. The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'kryptos' meaning
'hidden'. It is a colourless, odourless rare noble gas that reacts only with
fluorine. Krypton is obtained from production of liquid air. Krypton is used in
lighting products. It is used as inert filler-gas in incandescent bulbs and
some is mixed with argon in fluorescent lamps. The most important use is in
flashing stroboscopic lamps that outline airport runways.
