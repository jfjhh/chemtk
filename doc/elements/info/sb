Antimony has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from
the Latin word 'stibium' meaning mineral 'stibnite'. It is a hard, brittle,
silvery-white semimetal that is stable in dry air. It is toxic by ingestion or
inhalation. Antimony is found in stibnite (Sb2S3) and in valentinite (Sb2O3).
It is alloyed with other metals to increase their hardness. It is used in the
manufacture of a few special types of semiconductor devices, also in plastics
and chemicals. A few kinds of over-the-counter cold and flu remedies use
antimony compounds.
