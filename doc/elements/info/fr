Francium

Symbol:   Fr
Relative atomic mass: [223]
Atomic number: 87
Group numbers: 1
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1939 Marguerite Perey (FR)

Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey (FR) in 1939. Named for 'France',
the nation of its discovery. It is a highly rare and unstable, radioactive
metal. Its chemical properties are similar to caesium. Francium is formed from
the decay of actinium. It can be produced by bombarding radium or astatine with
neutrons. Since its isotopes have such short half-lives there are no
commercially significant compounds of francium.
