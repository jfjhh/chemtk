Rutherfordium

Symbol:   Rf
Relative atomic mass: [267]
Atomic number: 104
Group numbers: 4
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1964 Albert Ghiorso & Berkely Lab. (US), Georgy Nikolaevich Flerov & JINR Dubna (RU)

Rutherfordium was discovered by workers at the Nuclear Institute at Dubna (RU)
and by workers at the University of California, Berkeley (US) in 1964. Name in
honour of Lord 'Rutherford', the physicist and chemist from New Zealand. It is
a synthetic radioactive metal. Rutherfordium was made by bombarding
californium-249 with beams of carbon-12 and 13. Six isotopes of rutherfordium
have so far been identified. Rutherfordium-261, the longest-lived, has a
half-life of 62 seconds.
