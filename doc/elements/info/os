Osmium

Symbol:   Os
Relative atomic mass: 190.23 +- 0.03
Atomic number: 76
Group numbers: 8
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1803 Smithson Tennant (GB)

Osmium was discovered by Smithson Tennant (GB) in 1803. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'osme' meaning 'smell'. It is a hard fine black
powder or hard, lustrous, blue-white metal. Osmium is unaffected by air, water
and acids. It has a characteristic acrid, chlorine like odour due to tetroxide
compound. Osmium tetroxide is highly toxic. Osmium is obtained from the same
ores as platinum. It is used to tip gold pen points, instrument pivots, to make
electric light filaments, and also used for high temperature alloys and
pressure bearings. Osmium is very hard and resists corrosion better than any
other element.
