Discovery: 1774 Johan Gottlieb Gahn (SE)

Manganese was discovered by Johan Gottlieb Gahn (SE) in 1774. The origin of the
name comes from the Latin word 'magnes' meaning 'magnet', or 'magnesia nigri'
meaning 'black magnesia' (MnO2). It is a hard, brittle, grey-white metal with a
pinkish tinge. Impure forms are reactive and rust like iron in moist air.
Manganese is most abundant ores are pyrolusite (MnO2), psilomelane [(Ba,H2O)
2Mn5O10] and rhodochrosite (MnCO3). Pure metal is produced by mixing MnO2 with
powered Al and ignited in a furnace. It's used in steel, batteries and
ceramics. The steel in railroad tracks can contain as much as 1.2% manganese.
It is crucial to the effectiveness of vitamin B1.
