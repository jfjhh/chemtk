Gallium

Symbol:   Ga
Relative atomic mass: 69.723 +- 0.001
Atomic number: 31
Group numbers: 13
Period: 4
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1875 Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR)

Gallium was discovered by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR) in 1875. The
origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'Gallia' meaning 'France'. It is a
soft, blue-white metal, stable in air and water that reacts violently with
chlorine and bromine. Gallium is found throughout the crust in minerals like
bauxite, germanite and coal. It is used in semiconductor production, in making
LED's (light-emitting diodes) and GaAs laser diodes.
