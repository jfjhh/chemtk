Rhodium

Symbol:   Rh
Relative atomic mass: 102.90550 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 45
Group numbers: 9
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1803 William Hyde Wollaston (GB)

Rhodium was discovered by William Hyde Wollaston (GB) in 1804. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'rhodon' meaning 'rose'. It is a hard,
silvery-white metal, inert in air and acids that reacts with fused alkalis.
Rhodium is obtained as a by-product of nickel production. It is used as a
coating to prevent wear on high quality science equipment and with platinum to
make thermocouples.
