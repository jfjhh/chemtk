Silver has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from
the Latin word 'argentum' meaning 'silver'. It is a silvery-ductile and
malleable metal, stable in water and oxygen. Silver reacts with sulfur
compounds to form black sulfides. Silver is found in ores called argentite
(AgS), light ruby silver (Ag3AsS3), dark ruby silver (Ag3SbS3) and brittle
silver. It is used in alloys for jewellery and in other compounds for
photography. Silver is also a good conductor, but expensive.
