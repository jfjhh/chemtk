Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1803 William Hyde Wollaston (GB)

Palladium was discovered by William Hyde Wollaston (GB) in 1803. Named after
the asteroid 'Pallas' which was discovered at about the same time and from the
Greek name 'Pallas', goddess of wisdom. It is a soft, malleable, ductile,
silvery-white metal that resists corrosion, dissolves in oxidizing acids and
absorbs hydrogen. Metal dust is combustible. Palladium is obtained with
platinum, nickel, copper and mercury ores. It is used as a substitute for
silver in dental items and jewellery. The pure metal is used as the delicate
mainsprings in analog wristwatches. It is also used in surgical instruments and
as a catalyst.
