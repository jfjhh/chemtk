Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1807 Sir Humphry Davy (GB)

Sodium was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) in 1807. The origin of the name
comes from the Latin word 'natrium' meaning 'sodium carbonate'. It is a soft
silvery-white metal. Fresh surfaces oxidize rapidly. It reacts vigorously, even
violently with water giving off flammable gas. Sodium burns in air with a
brilliant white flame. Sodium is obtained by electrolysis of melted sodium
chloride (salt), borax and cryolite. Metallic sodium is vital in the
manufacture of organic compounds. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is table salt. Liquid
sodium is used to cool nuclear reactors.
