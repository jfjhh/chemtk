Gold has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from the
Latin word 'aurum' meaning 'gold'. It is a soft, malleable, bright yellow metal
that is unaffected by air, water, alkalis and most acids. Gold is found in
veins in the crust, with copper ore and native. It is used in electronics,
jewellery and coins. It is a good reflector of infrared radiation, so a thin
film of gold is applied to the glass of skyscrapers to reduce internal heating
from sunlight.
