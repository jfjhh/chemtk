Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1791 William Gregor (GB)

Titanium was discovered by William Gregor (GB) in 1791. Named after the
'Titans', the sons of the Earth goddess in Greek mythology. It is a shiny,
dark-grey metal. In powdered form it burns in air. Exposed surfaces form oxide
coating. It can be highly polished and is relatively immune to tarnishing.
Titanium is unreactive with alkali and most acids. Titanium usually occurs in
the minerals ilmenite (FeTiO3), rutile (TiO2) and iron ores. Pure metal
produced by heating TiO2 with carbon and chlorine to produce TiCl4 then heated
with Mg gas in argon atmosphere. Since it is strong and resists acids it is
used in many alloys. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a white pigment that covers
surfaces very well, is used in paint, rubber, paper and many others.
