Hafnium

Symbol:   Hf
Relative atomic mass: 178.49 +- 0.02
Atomic number: 72
Group numbers: 4
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1923 Dirk Coster (NL), George Charles von Hevesy (HU)

Hafnium was discovered by Dirk Coster (NL) and George Charles von Hevesy (HU)
in 1923. The origin of the name comes from the Latin name 'Hafnia' meaning
'Copenhagen'. It is a silvery, ductile, toxic metal that resists alkalis and
acids (except HF). Metal ignites and burns readily and the exposed surfaces
form oxide film. Hafnium is obtained from mineral zircon or baddeleyite. It is
used in reactor control rods because of its ability to absorb neutrons.
