Discovery: 1879 Lars Fredrik Nilson (SE)

Scandium was discovered by Lars Fredrik Nilson (SE) in 1879. The origin of the
name comes from the Latin word 'Scandia' meaning 'Scandinavia'. It is a fairly
soft, silvery-white metal. It burns easily and tarnishes readily in air, and
react with water to form hydrogen gas Scandium occurs mainly in the minerals
thortveitile (~34% scandium), wiikite and in some tin and tungsten ores. Pure
scandium is obtained as a by-product of uranium refining. Scandium metal is
used in some aerospace applications. Scandium oxide (Sc2O3) is used in the
manufacture of high-intensity electric lamps. Scandium iodide (ScI3) is used in
lamps that produce light having a colour closely matching natural sunlight.
