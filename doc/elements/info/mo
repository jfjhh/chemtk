Molybdenum

Symbol:   Mo
Relative atomic mass: 95.94 +- 0.02
Atomic number: 42
Group numbers: 6
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1778 Carl Wilhelm Scheele (SE)

Molybdenum was discovered by Carl William Scheele (SE) in 1778. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'molybdos' meaning 'lead'. It is a silvery
white, very hard metal, but is softer and more ductile than tungsten.
Molybdenum is found in the minerals molybdenite (MoS2) and wulfenite (MoO4Pb).
Its alloys are used in aircraft, missiles and protective coatings in boiler
plate.
