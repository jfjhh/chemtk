Discovery: 1996 Sigurd Hofmann & GSI Darmstadt (DE)

Copernicium was discovered by S. Hofmann (DE) et al. collaboration at the Heavy
Ion Research Laboratory (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in
Darmstadt, Germany in February 1996. Named in honour of Nicolaus Copernicus,
the Polish astronomer and mathematician. Copernicium was created by bombarding
the lead-208 nuclei with accelerated zinc-70 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator.
