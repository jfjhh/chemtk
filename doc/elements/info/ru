Atomic number: 44
Group numbers: 8
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus (RU)

Ruthenium was discovered by Karl Karlovich Klaus (RU) in 1844. The origin of
the name comes from the Latin word 'Ruthenia' meaning 'Russia'. It is a rare,
extremely brittle, silver-grey metal. Ruthenium is unaffected by air, water or
acids but reacts with very hot (molten) alkalis. Ruthenium is found in
pentlandite and pyroxinite. It is used to harden platinum and palladium,
aircraft magnetos use platinum alloy with 10% ruthenium.
