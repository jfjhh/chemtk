Terbium

Symbol:   Tb
Relative atomic mass: 158.92535 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 65
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1843 Carl Gustav Mosander (SE)

Terbium was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander (SE) in 1843. Named after
'Ytterby', a village in Sweden. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-grey, rare earth
metal that oxidizes slowly in air and reacts with cold water. Terbium is found
with other rare earths in monazite sand. Other sources are xenotime and
euxenite, both of which are oxide mixtures that can contain up to 1% terbium.
It is used in modest amounts in special lasers and solid-state devices.
