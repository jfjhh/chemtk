Discovery: 1772 Carl William Scheele (SE)

Oxygen was discovered by Carl William Scheele (SE) in 1772. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek words 'oxy genes' meaning 'acid' and 'forming' (acid
former). It is a colourless, odourless gas; pale blue liquid. Oxygen is
extremely reactive and forms oxides with nearly all other elements except noble
gases. It is the most abundant element in the earth's crust and makes up almost
21% of the atmosphere. Oxygen is obtained primarily from liquid air by
fractional distillation. Small amounts are made in the laboratory by
electrolysis of water. Oxygen is used in steel making, welding and supporting
life. Naturally occurring ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere shields the earth
from ultraviolet radiation.
