Relative atomic mass: [227]
Atomic number: 89
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1899 Andre-Louis Debierne (FR)

Actinium was discovered by Andre-Louis Debierne (FR) in 1899. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'aktinos' meaning 'ray'. It is a heavy,
silvery-white, very radioactive metal that reacts with water and glows in the
dark. Actinium is extremely rare, found in all uranium ores. It's usually
obtained by treating radium with neutrons in a reactor.
