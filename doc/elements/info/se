Selenium

Symbol:   Se
Relative atomic mass: 78.96 +- 0.03
Atomic number: 34
Group numbers: 16
Period: 4
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1817 Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE)

Selenium was discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE) in 1817. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'selene' meaning 'moon'. It is a soft metalloid
similar to sulfur, unaffected by water and soluble in alkalis and nitric acid.
The colour ranges from grey metallic to red glassy. Selenium burns in air and
is toxic by inhalation or ingestion. Also it conducts electricity when struck
by light. Selenium is obtained from lead, copper and nickel refining. Light
causes it to conduct electricity more easily. It is used in photoelectric
cells, TV cameras, xerography machines and as a semiconductor in solar
batteries and rectifiers, also colours glass red.
