Lithium

Symbol:   Li
Relative atomic mass: 6.941 +- 0.002
Atomic number: 3
Group numbers: 1
Period: 2
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1817 Johan August Arfvedsonn (SE)

Lithium was discovered by Johan August Arfvedson (SE) in 1817. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'lithos' meaning 'stone', apparently because
it was discovered from a mineral source whereas the other two elements, sodium
and potassium, were discovered from plant sources. It is a soft silvery-white
metal and it's the lightest of metals. Lithium reacts slowly with water and
oxygen. It's flammable and able to ignite in air. It reacts with water to give
off a flammable gas. Lithium is obtained by passing electric charge through
melted lithium chloride and from the silicate mineral called spodumene [LiAl
(Si2O6)]. Lithium is used in batteries, for certain kinds of glass and ceramics
and in lubricants.
