Zinc has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from the
German word 'zink'. It is a bluish-silver, ductile metal that reacts with
alkalis and acids. Zinc tarnishes in air. Zinc is found in the minerals zinc
blende (sphalerite) (ZnS), calamine, franklinite, smithsonite (ZnCO3),
willemite and zincite (ZnO). It is used to coat other metal (galvanizing) to
protect them from rusting, 90% of the zinc is used for galvanizing steel. Zinc
metal is used in the common dry-cell batteries and to make alloys such as
brass, bronze. Zinc compounds are used in the manufacture of paints, cosmetics,
plastics, electronic devices, and many other products.
