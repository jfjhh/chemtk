Neon

Symbol:   Ne
Relative atomic mass: 20.1797 +- 0.0006
Atomic number: 10
Group numbers: 18
Period: 2
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1898 Sir William Ramsay, Morris William Travers (GB)

Neon was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Morris William Travers (GB) in
1898. The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'neon' meaning 'new'. It
is a colourless, odourless inert gas. It doesn't react, not even with fluorine.
Neon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe. Neon is obtained by
liquefaction of air and separated from the other gases by fractional
distillation. The largest use for neon gas is in advertising signs.
