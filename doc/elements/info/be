Discovery: 1798 Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin (FR)

Beryllium was discovered by Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin (FR) in 1798. The origin
of the name comes from the Greek word 'beryllos' meaning mineral 'beryl'; also
called glucinium from the Greek word 'glykys' meaning 'sweet'. It is a
steel-grey metal resistant to attack by concentrated nitric acid. It has
excellent thermal conductivity and is nonmagnetic. At ordinary temperatures, it
resists oxidation in air. Beryllium and its salts are toxic and should be
handled with the greatest of care. Beryllium is found mostly in minerals like
beryl [AlBe3(Si6O18)] and chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4). Pure beryllium is obtained by
chemically reducing beryl mineral and by electrolysis of beryllium chloride.
Its ability to absorb large amounts of heat makes it useful in spacecrafts,
missiles, aircrafts, etc. Emeralds are beryl crystals with chromium traces
giving them their green colour.
