Ytterbium

Symbol:   Yb
Relative atomic mass: 173.04 +- 0.03
Atomic number: 70
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1878 Jean Charles Galinard de Marignac (CH)

Ytterbium was discovered by Jean Charles Galinard de Marignac (CH) in 1878.
Named after 'Ytterby', a village in Sweden. It is a silvery, lustrous,
malleable and ductile metal that oxidizes slowly in air and reacts with water.
Ytterbium dust is flammable. Ytterbium is found in minerals such as yttria,
monazite, gadolinite and xenotime. It is used in metallurgical and chemical
experiments.
