Discovery: 1817 Friedrich Strohmeyer (DE)

Cadmium was discovered by Friedrich Strohmeyer (DE) in 1817. The origin of the
name comes from the Latin word 'cadmia' meaning 'calamine' (zinc carbonate,
ZnCO3), or from the Greek word 'kadmeia' with the same meaning. It is a soft,
malleable, blue-white metal that tarnishes in air, soluble in acids, insoluble
in alkalis. Boiling cadmium gives off a weird, yellow-coloured vapour that is
poisonous. Cadmium can cause a variety of health problems, including kidney
failure and high blood pressure. Cadmium is obtained as a by product of zinc
refining. The mayor use of cadmium is in electroplating of steel to protect it
from corrosion. It is also used to make nickel-cadmium batteries. The ability
of cadmium to adsorb neutrons has made it of great importance in the design of
nuclear reactors. Its compounds are found in paint pigments and a wide variety
of intense colours.
