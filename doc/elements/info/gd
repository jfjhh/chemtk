Gadolinium

Symbol:   Gd
Relative atomic mass: 157.25 +- 0.03
Atomic number: 64
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1880 Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac (CH)

Gadolinium was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac (CH) in 1880.
Named after the mineral gadolinite, named for J. 'Gadolin', a Finnish chemist
and mineralogist. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that reacts slowly
with water and oxygen. Gadolinium dissolves in acids. The metal ignites and
burns readily. Gadolinium is found with other rare earths in gadolinite and
monazite sand. It is used in steel alloying agents and the manufacture of
electronic components.
