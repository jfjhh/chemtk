Mercury has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from
the Latin word 'hydrargyrum' meaning 'liquid silver'. It is a heavy,
silver-white metal, liquid at ordinary temperatures, stable in air and water.
Mercury is unreactive with alkalis and most acids. It gives off poisonous
vapour that has a chronic cumulative effect. Mercury rarely occurs free in
nature. The chief ore is cinnabar or mercury sulfide (HgS). It is used in
thermometers, barometers and batteries, also in electrical switches and
mercury-vapour lighting products.
