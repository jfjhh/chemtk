Iridium

Symbol:   Ir
Relative atomic mass: 192.217 +- 0.003
Atomic number: 77
Group numbers: 9
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1803 Smithson Tennant (GB)

Iridium was discovered by Smithson Tennant (GB) in 1803. The origin of the name
comes from the Latin word 'iris', meaning 'rainbow', because its salts are
highly coloured. It is a heavy, brittle, white metal that is unreactive in air,
water and acids but reacts with fused NaOH. Metal ignites and burns readily.
Iridium is found in gravel deposits with platinum. It is used with osmium to
tip gold pen points, to make crucible and special containers, also to make
alloys used for standard weights and measures and heat-resistant alloys. It is
used as a hardening agent for platinum.
