Lead has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from the
Latin word 'plumbum' meaning 'liquid silver'. It is a very soft, highly
malleable and ductile, blue-white shiny metal that tarnishes in moist air but
is stable in oxygen and water. Lead dissolves in nitric acid and its compounds
are toxic by inhalation or ingestion. The toxins have a cumulative effect. Lead
is found most often in ores called galena or lead sulfide (PbS). It is used in
solder, shielding against radiation and in batteries.
