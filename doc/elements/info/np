Neptunium

Symbol:   Np
Relative atomic mass: [237]
Atomic number: 93
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1940 Edwin Mattison McMillan, Philip Hauge Abelson (US)

Neptunium was discovered by Edwin Mattison McMillan and Philip Hauge Abelson
(US) in 1940. Named after the planet 'Neptune'. It is a rare, silvery
radioactive, radiotoxic metal that resists alkalis, reacts with oxygen, acid
and steam. Neptunium was produced by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons.
