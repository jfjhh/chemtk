Tin has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from the
Latin word 'stannum' meaning 'tin'. It is a silvery-white, soft, malleable and
ductile metal that ressist oxygen and water but dissolves in acids and bases.
Exposed surfaces form oxide film. Organic tin compounds may be highly toxic.
Tin is principally found in the ore cassiterite (SnO2) and stannine
(Cu2FeSnS4). It is used as a coating for steel cans since it is non-toxic and
non-corrosive, also in solder (33%Sn:67%Pb), bronze (20%Sn:80%Cu) and pewter.
Stannous fluoride (SnF2), a compound of tin and fluorine is used in some
toothpaste.
