Phosphorus

Symbol:   P
Relative atomic mass: 30.973762 +- 0.000002
Atomic number: 15
Group numbers: 15
Period: 3
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1669 Hennig Brandt (DE)

Phosphorus was discovered by Hennig Brandt (DE) in 1669. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'phosphoros' meaning 'bringer of light'. White
phosphorus is white to yellow soft, waxy phosphorescent solid with acrid fumes.
It's Toxic by inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. Red phosphorus is
powdery, non-flammable and non-toxic. Phosphorus is most often found in
phosphate rock. Pure form is obtained by heating a mixture of phosphate rock,
coke and silica to about 1450 Â°C. It is used in the production of fertilizers
and detergents. Some is used in fireworks, safety matches and incendiary
weapons. Phosphorus is also important in the production of steels, phosphor
bronze and many other products.
