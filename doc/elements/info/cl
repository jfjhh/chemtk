Discovery: 1774 Carl William Scheele (SE)

Chlorine was discovered by Carl William Scheele (SE) in 1774. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'chloros' meaning 'pale green'. It is a
greenish-yellow, disagreeable gas with irritating odour. The gas is toxic and
severe irritant by contact or inhalation. It's Never found in free form in
nature. Commercial quantities of chlorine are produced by electrolysis of
aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) from seawater or brine from salt mines. Sulfur
is used in water purification, bleaches, acids and many, many other compounds
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC).
