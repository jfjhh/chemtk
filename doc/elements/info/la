Discovery: 1839 Carl Gustaf Mosander (SE)

Lanthanum was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander (SE) in 1839. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'lanthanein' meaning 'to lie hidden'. It is
a soft, silvery-white, malleable, ductile metal that tarnishes readily in air
and reacts with oxidants. Reaction with water releases hydrogen gas, metal
ignites and burns readily. Lanthanum is found with rare earths in monazite and
bastnasite. Monazite sand typical contains 25% lanthanum. It is used in the
electrodes of high-intensity, carbon-arc lights. Because it gives glass
refractive properties, it is used in expensive camera lenses.
