Silicon

Symbol:   Si
Relative atomic mass: 28.0855 +- 0.0003
Atomic number: 14
Group numbers: 14
Period: 3
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1824 Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE)

Silicon was discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE) in 1824. The origin of the
name comes from the Latin word 'silicis' meaning 'flint'. Amorphous form of
silicon is brown powder; crystalline form has grey metallic appearance. The
solid form is unreactive with oxygen, water and most acids. It dissolves in hot
alkali. Silica dust is a moderately toxic acute irritant. Silicon makes up
major portion of clay, granite, quartz (SiO2) and sand. Commercial production
depends on a reaction between sand (SiO2) and carbon at a temperature of around
2200 Â°C. It is used in glass as silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silicon carbide (SiC)
is one of the hardest substances known and used in polishing. Silicon is by far
the more widely used semiconductor for electronics.
