Discovery: 1807 Sir Humphry Davy (GB)

Potassium was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) in 1807. The origin of the
name comes from the Arabic word 'qali' meaning 'alkali' (the origin of the
symbol K comes from the Latin word 'kalium'). It is a soft, waxy, silver-white
metal. Fresh surfaces have a silvery sheen. Potassium quickly forms dull oxide
coating on exposure to air. It reacts strongly with water and gives off a
flammable gas. It also reacts violently with oxidants. Potasium occurs only in
compounds. Potassium is found in minerals like carnallite [(KMgCl3).6H2O] and
sylvite (KCl). Pure metal is produced by the reaction of hot potassium chloride
and sodium vapours in a special retort. Pottasium is used as potash in making
glass and soap and as saltpetre, potassium nitrate (KNO3) to make explosives
and to colour fireworks in mauve. Potassium ions are vital to function of nerve
and muscle tissues.
