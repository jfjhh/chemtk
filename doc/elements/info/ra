Radium

Symbol:   Ra
Relative atomic mass: [226]
Atomic number: 88
Group numbers: 2
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1898 Marie Sklodowska Curie, Perre Curie (FR)

Radium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie and Perre Curie (FR) in 1898.
The origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'radius' meaning 'ray'. It is
a silvery-white radioactive metal that reacts with oxygen and water. It is
highly radiotoxic and carcinogen by inhalation, ingestion, or exposure. Radium
is found in uranium ores at 1 part per 3 million parts uranium. Used in
treating cancer because of the gamma rays it gives off.
