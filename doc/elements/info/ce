Cerium

Symbol:   Ce
Relative atomic mass: 140.116 +- 0.001
Atomic number: 58
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1803 Jons Jakob Berzelius, Wilhelm Hisinger (SE); Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE)

Cerium was discovered by Jons Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger (SE) in 1803
and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE). Named after the asteroid
'Ceres' discovered two years before the element. It is a malleable, ductile,
iron-grey metal that tarnishes in air and reacts easily with water. Cerium
dissolves in acids and ignites when heated. Metal ignites and burns readily.
Strong reductant. Cerium is most abundant rare earth metal. Found in many
minerals like monazite sand [Ce(PO4)]. Its oxides are used in the optics and
glass-making industries. Its salts are used in the photography and textile
industry. Cerium is also used in high-intensity carbon lamps and as alloying
agents in special metals.
