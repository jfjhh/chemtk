Discovery: 1894 Lord Raleigh, Sir William Ramsay (GB)

Argon was discovered by Lord Raleigh and Sir William Ramsay (GB) in 1894. The
origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'argos' meaning 'inactive'. It is
a colourless and odourless noble gas, chemically inert. Argon is the third most
abundant element in the earth's atmosphere and makes up about 1%. Argon is
continuously released into the air by decay of radioactive potassium-40. Pure
form is obtained from fractional distillation of liquid air. It is used in
lighting products, and is often used in filling incandescent light bulbs. Some
is mixed with krypton in fluorescent lamps. Crystals in the semiconductor
industry are grown in argon atmospheres.
