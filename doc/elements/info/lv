Livermorium

Symbol:   Lv
Relative atomic mass: [291]
Atomic number: 116
Group numbers: 16
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 2004 Yuri Oganessian & JINR Dubna (RU), Kenton Moody & LLNL Livermore

Both Flerovium and Livermorium were detected in Russian labs over ten years ago
(1998 and 2000), but the half-lives of the particles were so short that the
scientists were unable to verify their discoveries. The discoveries were
confirmed in 2004 through a collaborative effort scientists from the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Rusia, and the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, USA, led by
Rusian physicist Yuri Tsolakovich Oganessian (1933-) and American chemist
Kenton J. (Ken) Moody. The Dubna-Livermore collaboration be credited with the
discovery of the new element with Z = 116. Livermorium, previously known as
ununhexium, received its name from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
It is a synthetic radioactive element that do not occour naturally in earth.
Livermorium was produced by bombarding curium-245 with calcium-48.
