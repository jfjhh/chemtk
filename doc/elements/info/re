Discovery: 1925 Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke-Noddack, Otto Berg (DE)

Rhenium was discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke-Noddack and Otto Berg (DE)
in 1925. The origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'Rhenus' meaning
river 'Rhine'. It is a rare and costly, dense, silvery-white metal that
tarnishes in moist air, resists corrosion and oxidation .Rhenium dissolves in
nitric and sulfuric acids but has a very high melting point. Rhenium is found
in small amounts in gadolinite and molybdenite. It is mixed with tungsten or
platinum to make filaments for mass spectrographs. Its main value is as a trace
alloying agent for hardening metal components that are subjected to continuous
frictional forces.
