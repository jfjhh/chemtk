Relative atomic mass: [262]
Atomic number: 103
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1961 Albert Ghiorso, Torbjorn Sikkeland, Almon E. Larsh, R.M. Latimer (US)

Lawrencium was discovered by Albert Ghiorso, Torbjorn Sikkeland, Almon E.
Larsh, and Robert M. Latimer (US) in 1961. Named in honour of Ernest O.
'Lawrence', inventor of the cyclotron. It is a synthetic radioactive metal.
Lawrencium was produced by bombarding a mixture of three isotopes of
californium with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. Eight isotopes of lawrencium have
been synthesized to date, with the longest-lived being lawrencium-256, which
has a half-life of about 30 seconds.
