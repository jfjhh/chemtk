Discovery: 1885 Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT)

Praseodymium was discovered by Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT) in 1885.
The origin of the name comes from the Greek words 'prasios didymos' meaning
'green twin'. It is a silvery white, moderately soft, malleable, ductile metal
that reacts slowly with oxygen but reacts rapidly with water. Metal ignites and
burns readily. Praseodymium is obtained from same salts as neodymium. It is
used with neodymium to make lenses for glass maker's goggles since it filters
out the yellow light present in glass blowing. Alloyed with magnesium
praseodymium creates a high-strength metal used in aircraft engines. Misch
metal, used in the manufacture of pyrophoric alloys for cigarette lighters,
contains about 5% praseodymium metal. (Typically composition of misch metal are
Ce:Nd:Pr:La:Other rare earth=50:18:6:22:4).
