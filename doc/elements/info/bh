Discovery: 1981 Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Munzenber & GSI Darmstadt (DE)

Bohrium was discovered by Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Munzenber (DE) and their
co-workers at the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory (Gesellschaft fur
Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany in 1981. Named in honour of
Niels 'Bohr', the Danish physicist. It is a synthetic radioactive metal.
Bohrium was produced by bombarding bismuth-204 with chromium-54.
