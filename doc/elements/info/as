Discovery: 1250 Albertus Magnus (DE)

Arsenic was discovered by Albertus Magnus (DE) in 1250. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'arsenikon' meaning 'yellow orpiment'. It is a
steel-grey, brittle semi-metal that resists water, acids and alkalis. It
tarnishes in air, burns in oxygen and is highly toxic by inhalation or
ingestion. Arsenic is found in mispickel (arsenopyrite). Many of its compounds
are deadly poison and used as weed killer and rat poison. Some compounds,
called arsenides, are used in the manufacture of paints, wallpapers and
ceramics. It is also used in semiconductors
