Discovery: 1886 Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR)

Dysprosium was discovered by Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR) in 1886. The
origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'dysprositos' meaning 'hard to
obtain'. It is a soft, lustrous, silvery metal that reacts with oxygen and
water. Dysprosium is a reductant and dissolves in acids. Metal ignites and
burns readily. Dysprosium is usually found with erbium, holmium and other rare
earths in some minerals such as monazite sand. Dysprosium uses are limited to
the experimental and esoteric. Some isotopes of dysprosium are effective
absorbers of thermal neutrons and are being considered for use in the control
rods in nuclear reactors.
