Yttrium

Symbol:   Y
Relative atomic mass: 88.90585 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 39
Group numbers: 3
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1794 Johan Gadolin (FI)

Yttrium was discovered by Johan Gadolin (FI) in 1794. Named after 'Ytterby', a
village in Sweden. It is a silvery, ductile, fairly reactive metal that is
easily combustible, reacts with oxygen in water to release hydrogen. Exposed
surfaces form oxide film. Yttrium is found in minerals such as monazite,
xenotime and yttria. It is combined with europium to make red phosphors for
colour TV's. Yttrium oxide and iron oxide combine to form a crystal garnet used
in radar.
