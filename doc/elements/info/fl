Relative atomic mass: [287]
Atomic number: 114
Group numbers: 14
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 2004 Yuri Oganessian & JINR Dubna (RU), Kenton Moody & LLNL Livermore

Both Flerovium and Livermorium were detected in Russian labs over ten years ago
(1998 and 2000), but the half-lives of the particles were so short that the
scientists were unable to verify their discoveries. The discoveries were
confirmed in 2004 through a collaborative effort scientists from the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Rusia, and the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, USA, led by
Rusian physicist Yuri Tsolakovich Oganessian (1933-) and American chemist
Kenton J. (Ken) Moody. The Dubna-Livermore collaboration be credited with the
discovery of the new element with Z = 114. Temporarily known as ununquadium,
flerovium was named in honor of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions
where superheavy elements are synthesised. The Soviet physicist Georgi
Nikolaevich Flerov (1913-1990) was a pioneer in heavy-ion physics who founded
the JINR in Dubna. It is a synthetic radioactive element that do not occour
naturally in earth. Flerovium was produced by bombarding plutonium-242 with
calcium-48.
