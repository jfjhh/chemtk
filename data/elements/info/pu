Plutonium

Symbol:   Pu
Relative atomic mass: [244]
Atomic number: 94
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1940 Glenn Theodore Seaborg, Joseph W. Kennedy, Arthur C. Wahl (US)

Plutonium was discovered by Glenn Theodore Seaborg, Joseph W. Kennedy, and
Arthur C. Wahl (US) in 1940. Named after the planet 'Pluto'. It is a
silvery-white, extremely radioactive, highly toxic, artificially produced metal
that reacts with oxygen, acids and steam, but it resists alkalis. Plutonium is
found rarely in some uranium ores. It can be made by bombarding uranium with
neutrons. Plutonium is used in bombs and reactors. Small quantities are used in
thermo-electric generators.
