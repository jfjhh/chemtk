Discovery: 1557 Julius Caesar Scaliger (IT)

Platinum was discovered by Julius Caesar Scaliger (IT) in 1557. The origin of
the name comes from the Spanish word 'platina' meaning 'silver'. It is a rare,
very heavy, soft, silvery-white metal that resists oxygen, water, corrosion,
and acid attacks except aqua regia. Platinum is produced from deposits of
native, or elemental. It is used in jewellery, to make crucible and special
containers and as a catalyst. Platinum is used with cobalt to produce very
strong magnets, also to make standard weights and measures.
