Curium

Symbol:   Cm
Relative atomic mass: [247]
Atomic number: 96
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1944 Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, Albert Ghiorso (US)

Curium was discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso
(US) in 1944. Named in honour of Pierre and Marie 'Curie'. It is a silvery,
malleable, synthetic radioactive metal. So radioactive it glows in the dark.
Curium was made by bombarding plutonium with helium ions.
