Roentgenium

Symbol:   Rg
Relative atomic mass: [280]
Atomic number: 111
Group numbers: 11
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1994 Sigurd Hofmann & GSI Darmstadt (DE)

Roentgenium was discovered by S. Hofmann (DE) et al. collaboration at the Heavy
Ion Research Laboratory (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in
Darmstadt, Germany in December 1994. Named in honour of Wilhelm Conrad
'Roentgen'. It is a synthetic radioactive metal. It is created in the
bombardments of 209Bi targets with 64Ni using the velocity selector SHIP
facility to discriminate in favor of the fused product, 272111 + 1n, three sets
of localized alpha-decay chains were observed with position-sensitive
detectors.
