Atomic number: 54
Group numbers: 18
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1898 Sir William Ramsay, Morris William Travers (GB)

Xenon was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Morris William Travers (GB) in
1898. The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'xenos' meaning
'stranger'. It is a heavy, colourless, odourless, noble gas that reacts only
with fluorine. Xenon is obtain from the small quantities in liquid air. It is
used for filling flash lamps and other powerful lamps. Electrical excitation of
xenon produces a burst of brilliant white light. It is also used in bubble
chambers and modern nuclear power reactors.
