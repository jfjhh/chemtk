Uranium

Symbol:   U
Relative atomic mass: 238.02891 +- 0.00003
Atomic number: 92
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1789 Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE)

Uranium was discovered by Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE) in 1789. Named after
the planet 'Uranus'. It is a silvery-white, dense, ductile, malleable,
radioactive, radiotoxic metal that resists alkalis, tarnishes in air and reacts
with steam and acids. Uranium occurs in many rocks, but in large amounts only
in such minerals as pitchblende and carnotite. For many centuries it was used
as a pigment for glass. Now it is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors and in
bombs.
