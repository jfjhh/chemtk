Rubidium

Symbol:   Rb
Relative atomic mass: 85.4678 +- 0.0003
Atomic number: 37
Group numbers: 1
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1861 Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (DE)

Rubidium was discovered by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff
(DE) in 1861. The origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'rubidius'
meaning 'dark red' or 'deepest red'. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly
reactive metal that ignites in air and reacts violently with water or oxidants.
Rubidium occurs abundantly, but so widespread that production is limited. It is
usually obtained from lithium production. It is used in photocells, cathode-ray
and vacuum tubes, and as a catalyst.
