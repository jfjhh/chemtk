Radon

Symbol:   Rn
Relative atomic mass: [222]
Atomic number: 86
Group numbers: 18
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1899 Robert Bowie Owens, Ernest Rutherford (GB)

Radon was discovered by Robert Bowie Owens and Ernest Rutherford (GB) in 1899.
The origin of the name is variation of the name of element 'radium'; radon was
called niton at first, from the Latin word 'nitens' meaning 'shining'. It is a
colourless, odourless radioactive, heavy, noble gas that is chemically inert
and non-flammable but is highly radiotoxic and carcinogen by inhalation. Radon
is formed from the decay of radium in the earths crust. It is used to treat
some forms of cancer.
