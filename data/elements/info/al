Discovery: 1825 Hans Christian Orsted (DK)

Aluminium (or aluminum) was discovered by Hans Christian Orsted (DK) in 1825.
The origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'alumen' meaning 'alum'. It is
a soft, lightweight, silvery-white metal. Exposed surfaces quickly form
protective oxide coating. It reacts violently with oxidants. Aluminium is third
most abundant element in the earth's crust. Aluminium is the most abundant
metal to be found in the earth's crust, but is never found free in nature.
Aluminium is obtained by electrolysis from bauxite. Aluminium used for many
purposes from airplanes to beverage cans. It is too soft in its pure form so
less than 1 % of silicon or iron is added, which hardens and strengthens it.
