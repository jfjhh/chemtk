Discovery: 1974 Albert Ghiorso, Kenneth Hulet et al. (US)

Seaborgium was discovered by workers at the Nuclear Institute at Dubna (RU) and
by workers at the University of California, Berkeley (US) in 1974. Named in
honour of Glenn T. 'Seaborg', American nuclear chemist and Nobel prize winner.
It is a synthetic radioactive metal. Seaborgium was made by bombarding
californium-249 with oxygen-18.
