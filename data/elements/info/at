Astatine

Symbol:   At
Relative atomic mass: [210]
Atomic number: 85
Group numbers: 17
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1940 Emilio Segre, Dale Raymond Corson, Kenneth Ross Mackenzie (US)

Astatine was discovered by Emilio Segre, Dale Raymond Corson, and Kenneth Ross
Mackenzie (US) in 1940. The origin of the name comes from the Greek word
'astatos' meaning 'unstable'. It is a unstable, radioactive member of the
halogen group. Astatine does not occur in nature, it is similar to iodine.
Astatine is produced by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles. Since its
isotopes have such short half-lives there are no commercially significant
compounds of astatine.
