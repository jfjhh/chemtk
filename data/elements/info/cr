Discovery: 1797 Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin (FR)

Chromium was discovered by Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin (FR) in 1797. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'chroma' meaning 'colour'. It is a very
hard, crystalline, steel-grey metal. The pure metal has a blue-white colour. It
is hard, brittle and corrosion-resistant at normal temperatures. Hexavalent
compounds are toxic by skin contact. The most important chromium mineral is
chromite [Fe,Mg(CrO4)]. It is produced commercially by heating its ore in the
presence of silicon or aluminium. Chromium is used to make stainless steel; it
gives the colour to rubies and emeralds. Iron-nickel-chromium alloys in various
percentages yield an incredible variety of the most important metals in modern
technology.
