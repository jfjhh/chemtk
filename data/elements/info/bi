Bismuth

Symbol:   Bi
Relative atomic mass: 208.98040 +- 0.00001
Atomic number: 83
Group numbers: 15
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1450 Basil Valentine (DE)

Bismuth was discovered by Basil Valentine (DE) in 1450. The origin of the name
comes from the German words 'Weisse Masse' meaning 'white mass'; now spelled
'wismut' and 'bisemutum'. It is a hard, brittle, steel-grey metal with a pink
tint. It is stable in oxygen and water but dissolves in concentrated nitric
acid. Bismuth can be found free in nature and in minerals like bismuthine
(Bi2S3) and in bismuth ochre (Bi2O3) Main use is in pharmaceuticals and low
melting point alloys used as fuses.
