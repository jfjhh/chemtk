Discovery: 1772 Daniel Rutherford (GB)

Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford (GB) in 1772. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek words 'nitron genes' meaning 'nitre' and 'forming'
and the Latin word 'nitrum' (nitre is a common name for potassium nitrate,
KNO3). It is a colourless, odourless, generally inert gas, minimally reactive
at room temperature. Nitrogen is a component of many organic and inorganic
compounds and makes up about 78% of earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is obtained
from liquid air by fractional distillation. Nitrogen is primarily used to
produce ammonia and other fertilizers and for making nitric acid, which is used
in explosives. It is also used in welding and enhanced oil recovery.
