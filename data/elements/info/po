Polonium

Symbol:   Po
Relative atomic mass: [209]
Atomic number: 84
Group numbers: 16
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1898 Marie Sklodowska Curie, Pierre Curie (FR)

Polonium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie and Pierre Curie (FR) in
1898. Named for 'Poland', native country of Marie Curie. It is a silvery-grey,
extremely rare, highly toxic, severe radiotoxic, carcinogen, radioactive metal
that is soluble in dilute acids. Polonium occurs in pitchblende. It's produced
by bombarding bismuth with neutrons. It is used in industrial equipment that
eliminates static electricity caused by such processes as rolling paper, wire
and sheet metal.
