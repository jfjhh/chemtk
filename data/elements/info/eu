Discovery: 1896 Eugene-Anatole Demarcay (FR)

Europium was discovered by Eugene-Anatole Demarcay (FR) in 1896. Named for the
continent of 'Europe'. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that is extremely
reactive with oxygen and water. Europium is obtained from monazite sand, which
is a mixture of phosphates of calcium, thorium, cerium and most other rare
earths. It is used with yttrium oxide to make red phosphors for colour
televisions.
