Atomic number: 53
Group numbers: 17
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1811 Bernard Courtois (FR)

Iodine was discovered by Bernard Courtois (FR) in 1811. The origin of the name
comes from the Greek word 'iodes' meaning 'violet'. It is a shiny, black,
non-metallic solid with characteristic odour. It sublimes easily and as a gas
it is violet and intensely irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. Iodine
occurs on land and in the sea in sodium and potassium compounds. It is required
in small amounts by humans. Iodine was once used as an antiseptic, but no
longer due to its poisonous nature.
