Samarium

Symbol:   Sm
Relative atomic mass: 150.36 +- 0.02
Atomic number: 62
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1879 Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR)

Samarium was discovered by Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (FR) in 1879. Named
after the mineral 'samarskite'. It is a silvery rare earth metal that is stable
in dry air but reacts with water. Oxide coating forms on surfaces exposed to
moist air and the metal ignites and burns readily. Samarium is found with other
rare earths in monazite sand. It is used in the electronics and ceramics
industries. It is easily magnetized and very difficult to demagnetise. This
suggests important future applications in solid-state and superconductor
technologies.
