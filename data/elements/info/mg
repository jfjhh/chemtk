Discovery: 1808 Sir Humphry Davy (GB)

Magnesium was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) in 1808. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'Magnesia', a district of Thessaly. It is a
lightweight, malleable, silvery-white metal that burns in air with a brilliant
white flame and reacts with water as temperature elevates. It can ignite in air
and it reacts violently with oxidants. Magnesium is found in large deposits in
the form of magnesite, dolomite and other minerals. It is usually obtained by
electrolysis of melted magnesium chloride (MgCl2) derived from brines, wells
and sea water. Magnesium is used in alloys to make airplanes, missiles and
other uses for light metals. It has structural properties similar to aluminium.
