Discovery: 1944 Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, Leon O. Morgan, Albert Ghiorso (US)

Americium was discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, Leon O. Morgan,
and Albert Ghiorso (US) in 1944. Named for the 'American' continent. It is a
silvery-white, artificially produced radioactive metal. Americium was produced
by bombarding plutonium with neutrons. Americium-241 is currently used in smoke
detectors.
