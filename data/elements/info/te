Tellurium

Symbol:   Te
Relative atomic mass: 127.60 +- 0.03
Atomic number: 52
Group numbers: 16
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1782 Franz Joseph Muller von Reichstein (AT)

Tellurium was discovered by Franz Joseph Muller von Reichstein (AT) in 1782.
The origin of the name comes from the Latin word 'tellus' meaning 'earth'. It
is a silvery-white, brittle semi-metal that is unreactive with water or HCl,
burns in air or oxygen and dissolves in HNO3. Tellurium is obtained as a
by-product of copper and lead refining. It is used to improve the machining
quality of copper and stainless steel products and to colour glass and
ceramics. It is also used in thermoelectric devices, in the rubber industry and
it is a basic ingredient in manufacturing blasting caps.
