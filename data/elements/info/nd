Discovery: 1885 Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT)

Neodymium was discovered by Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach (AT) in 1885. The
origin of the name comes from the Greek words 'neos didymos' meaning 'new
twin'. It is a silvery-white, rare-earth metal that oxidizes easily in air and
reacts slowly in cold water, but more rapidly as heated. Metal ignites and
burns readily. Neodymium is made from electrolysis of its halide salts, which
are made from monazite sand. It is used in making artificial ruby for lasers,
in ceramics and for a special lens with praseodymium, also to produce bright
purple glass and special glass that filters infrared radiation. Misch metal,
used in the manufacture of pyrophoric alloys for cigarette lighters, contains
about 18% neodymium metal. (Typically composition of misch metal are
Ce:Nd:Pr:La:Other rare earth=50:18:6:22:4). Neodymium is used to create some of
the most powerful permanent magnets on Earth, known as NIB magnets they consist
of neodymium, iron, and boron.
