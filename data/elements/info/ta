Discovery: 1802 Anders Gustaf Ekeberg (SE)

Tantalum was discovered by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg (SE) in 1802. The origin of
the name comes from the Greek word 'Tantalos' meaning 'father of Niobe' in
Greek mythology, (tantalum is closely related to niobium in the periodic
table). It is a rare, grey, heavy, hard but ductile, metal with a high melting
point that reacts with HF and fused alkalis. Metal ignites in air and exposed
surfaces form corrosion resistant oxide film. Tantalum is always found with
niobium but occurs chiefly in the mineral tantalite. It is often used as an
economical substitute for platinum. Tantalum pentoxide is used in capacitors
and in camera lenses to increase refracting power. It and its alloys are
corrosion and wear resistant so it is used to make surgical and dental tools.
