Strontium

Symbol:   Sr
Relative atomic mass: 87.62 +- 0.01
Atomic number: 38
Group numbers: 2
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1789 Adair Crawford (GB)

Strontium was discovered by Adair Crawford (GB) in 1789. Named after the
village of 'Strontian' in Scotland. It is a soft, malleable, silvery-yellow
metal that is combustible in air and reacts with water. Exposed surfaces form
protective oxide film. It ignites and burns readily. Strontium is found in
minerals celestite and strontianite. Strontium is used in flares and fireworks
for crimson colour. Strontium-90 is a long lived highly radioactive fallout
product of atomic-bomb explosions.
