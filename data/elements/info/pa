Protactinium

Symbol:   Pa
Relative atomic mass: 231.03588 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 91
Group numbers: 3
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1913 Kasimir Fajans, Otto H. Gohring (DE)

Protactinium was discovered by Kasimir Fajans and Otto H. Gohring (DE) in 1913.
The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'protos' meaning 'first'. It
is a very rare, silvery-white, extremely radioactive metal that resists
alkalis, reacts with oxygen, acids and steam. Protactinium is highly
radiotoxic, extremely toxic and must be handled with great care. Protactinium
does not occur in nature. It is found among fission products of uranium,
thorium and plutonium.
