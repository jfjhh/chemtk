Holmium

Symbol:   Ho
Relative atomic mass: 164.93032 +- 0.00002
Atomic number: 67
Group numbers: 3
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1879 Per Theodor Cleve (SE)

Holmium was discovered by Per Theodore Cleve (SE) in 1879. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'Holmia' meaning 'Stockholm'. It is a fairly
soft, malleable, lustrous, silvery metal that reacts slowly with oxygen and
water. Holmium dissolves in acids and is able to react violently with air or
halogens. Holmium occurs in gadolinite but most often it's produced from
monazite sand. It has very few practical applications; however, it has some
unusual magnetic properties that offer some hope for future applications.
