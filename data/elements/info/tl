Thallium

Symbol:   Tl
Relative atomic mass: 204.3833 +- 0.0002
Atomic number: 81
Group numbers: 13
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1861 Sir William Crookes (GB)

Thallium was discovered by Sir William Crookes (GB) in 1861. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek word 'thallos' meaning 'green twig' or 'green shoot'.
It is a soft grey metal that looks like lead and tarnishes in moist air.
Thallium reacts in heated moist air and in acids. Its compounds are highly
toxic by inhalation or ingestion and have a cumulative effect. Thallium is
found in iron pyrites, in crookesite, hutchinsonite and lorandite. Most is
recovered from the by-products of lead and zinc refining. Its compounds are
used in rat and ant poisons and for detecting infrared radiation.
