Atomic number: 27
Group numbers: 9
Period: 4
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1739 Georg Brandt (DE)

Cobalt was discovered by Georg Brandt (DE) in 1739. The origin of the name
comes from the German word 'kobald' meaning 'goblin' or evil spirit. It is a
hard, ductile, lustrous bluish-grey metal and it's surfaces are stable in air.
Cobalt reacts over time with dilute acids and has remarkable magnetic
properties. Cobalt occurs in compounds with arsenic and sulfur as in cobaltine
(CoAsS) and linneite (Co3S4). Pure cobalt is obtained as a by-product of
refining nickel, copper and iron. Cobalt is used in many hard alloys; for
magnets, ceramics and special glasses. Radioactive cobalt-60 is used in cancer
therapy.
