Discovery: 1947 Jacob Akiba Marinsky, Lawrence Elgin Glendenin, Charles DuBois Coryell (US)

Promethium was discovered by Jacob Akiba Marinsky, Lawrence Elgin Glendenin,
and Charles DuBois Coryell (US) in 1947. Named after 'Prometheus' in Greek
mythology, who stole fire from the gods. It is a rare earth metal of synthetic
origin on the earth, naturally made in stars. It is Poisonous, radiotoxic and
radioactive. Promethium does not occur naturally. It is found among fission
products of uranium, thorium and plutonium. It has been used as a source of
radioactivity for thickness-measuring gages.
