Carbon has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from
the Latin word 'carbo' meaning 'charcoal'. Carbon has three forms: graphite,
diamond and c60. Graphite form of carbon is a black, odourless, slippery solid
and sublimes at 3825 Â°C. Diamond form is a clear or coloured; an extremely hard
solid. C60 is Buckminsterfullerine. Carbon black burns readily with oxidants.
Carbon is made by burning organic compounds with insufficient oxygen. There are
close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital
to organic and life processes. Radiocarbon dating uses the carbon-14 isotope to
date old objects.
