Symbol:   B
Relative atomic mass: 10.811 +- 0.007
Atomic number: 5

Discovery: 1808 Sir Humphry Davy (GB); Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis-Jaques Thenard (FR)

Boron compounds have been known for thousands of years, but the element was not
discovered until 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) and independently by
Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jaques Thenard (FR). The origin of the name
comes from the Arabic word 'buraq' and the Persian word 'burah' meaning
'boraks' (Na2B4O7Ã—10H2O). It is hard, brittle, lustrous black semimetal. Boron
is unreactive with oxygen, water, alkalis or acids. It combines with most
metals to form borides. Boron is obtained from kernite, a kind of borax
(Na2B4O7.10H2O). High purity boron is produced by electrolysis of molten
potassium fluroborate and potassium chloride (KCl). Amorphous boron is used in
pyrotechnic flares to provide a distinctive green colour and in rockets as an
igniter.
