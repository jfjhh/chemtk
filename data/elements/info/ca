Discovery: 1808 Sir Humphry Davy (GB)

Calcium was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy (GB) in 1808. The origin of the name
comes from the Latin word 'calx' meaning 'lime'. It is a fairly hard,
silvery-white metal. Exposed surfaces form oxides and nitrides. Calcium reacts
with water and oxygen. It only occurs in compounds. Calcium is obtained from
minerals like chalk, limestone and marble. Pure metal is produced by replacing
the calcium in lime (CaCO3) with aluminium in hot, low pressure retorts.
Calcium is used by many forms of life to make shells and bones, as a pure metal
it has little use, however two of its compounds, lime (CaO) and gypsum (CaSO4),
are in great demand by a number of industries.
