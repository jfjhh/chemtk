Sulfur (or sulphur) has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name
comes from the Latin word 'sulfur' (or 'sulpur' or 'sulphur') which derived
from the Sanskrit word 'sulvere'. It is a pale yellow, odourless, brittle
solid, which is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide. Sulfur is
found in pure form and in ores like cinnabar, galena, sphalerite and stibnite.
Pure form is obtained from underground deposits by the Frasch process. Sulfur
is used in matches, gunpowder, medicines, rubber and pesticides, dyes and
insecticides, and for making sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
