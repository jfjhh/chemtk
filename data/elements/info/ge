Germanium

Symbol:   Ge
Relative atomic mass: 72.64 +- 0.01
Atomic number: 32
Group numbers: 14
Period: 4
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1886 Clemens Alexander Winkler (DE)

Germanium was discovered by Clemens Alexander Winkler (DE) in 1886. The origin
of the name comes from the Latin word 'Germania' meaning 'Germany'. It is a
greyish-white semi-metal, stable in air and water. Germanium is unaffected by
alkalis and most (except nitric) acids. Germanium is obtained from refining
copper, zinc and lead. It is widely used in semiconductors when combined with
tiny amounts of phosphorus, arsenic, gallium and antimony.
