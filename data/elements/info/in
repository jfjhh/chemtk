Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1863 Ferdinand Reich, Hieronymus Theodor Richter (DE)

Indium was discovered by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymus Theodor Richter (DE) in
1863. Named after the 'indicum' (colour indigo), the colour it shows in a
spectroscope. It is a rare, very soft, silver-white metal that is stable in air
and water but dissolves in acids. Metal can ignite and burn. Indium is found in
certain zinc ores. It is used to coat high speed bearings and as an alloy that
lowers the melting point of other metals. Relatively small amounts are used in
dental items and in electronic semiconductors.
