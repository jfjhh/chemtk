Copper has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from
the Latin word 'cuprum' meaning the island of 'Cyprus' famed for its copper
mines. It is a malleable, ductile, reddish-brown metal, resistant to air and
water. Exposed surfaces form greenish carbonate film. Pure copper occurs rarely
in nature. It is usually found in sulfides as in chalcopyrite (CuFeS2),
coveline (CuS), chalcosine (Cu2S) or oxides like cuprite (Cu2O). Copper is most
often used as an electrical conductor and in the manufacture of water pipes.
Its alloys are used in jewellery and for coins.
