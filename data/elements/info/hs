Hassium

Symbol:   Hs
Relative atomic mass: [277]
Atomic number: 108
Group numbers: 8
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1984 Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Munzenber & GSI Darmstadt (DE)

Hassium was discovered by Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Munzenber (DE) and their
co-workers at the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory (Gesellschaft fur
Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany in 1984. The origin of the
name is the Latin word 'Hassias' meaning 'Hess', the German state. It is a
synthetic radioactive metal. Hassium was produced by bombarding lead-208 with
iron-58.
