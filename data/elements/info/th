Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1828 Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE)

Thorium was discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius (SE) in 1828. Named after
'Thor', the mythological Scandinavian god of war. It is a heavy, grey, soft,
malleable, ductile, radioactive metal that tarnishes in air and reacts with
water. It reacts violently with oxidants. Thorium is found in various minerals
like monazite and thorite. It is used in making strong alloys, in ultraviolet
photoelectric cells. It is a common ingredient in high-quality lenses. When
bombarded with neutrons thorium creates uranium-233, a nuclear fuel.
