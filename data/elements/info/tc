Technetium

Symbol:   Tc
Relative atomic mass: [98]
Atomic number: 43
Group numbers: 7
Period: 5
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1937 Carlo Perrier (IT), Emilio Segre (US)

Technetium was discovered by Carlo Perrier (IT) and Emilio Segre (US) in 1937.
The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'technikos' meaning
'artificial'. It is a silvery-grey metal that resists oxidation but tarnishes
in moist air and burns in high oxygen environment. Technetium is the first
synthetically produced element. It is also radioactive. Technetium is made by
bombarding molybdenum with deuterons (heavy hydrogen) in a cyclotron. Added to
iron in quantities as low as 55 part-per-million transforms the iron into a
corrosion-resistant alloy.
