Caesium (Cesium)

Symbol:   Cs
Relative atomic mass: 132.9054519 +- 0.0000002
Atomic number: 55
Group numbers: 1
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1860 Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (DE)

Caesium (or cesium) was discovered by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert
Kirchhoff (DE) in 1860. The origin of the name comes from the Latin word
'caesius' meaning 'sky blue' or 'heavenly blue'. It is a very soft, light grey,
ductile metal that reacts readily with oxygen and reacts explosively with
water. Caesium is found in pollucite [(Cs4Al4Si9O26).H2O] and as trace in
lepidolite. It is used as a 'getter' to remove air traces in vacuum and
cathode-ray tubes, in producing photoelectric devices and atomic clocks. Since
it ionises readily, it is used as an ion rocket motor propellant.
