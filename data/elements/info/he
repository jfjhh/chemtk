Helium

Symbol:   He
Relative atomic mass: 4.002602 +- 0.000002
Atomic number: 2
Group numbers: 18
Period: 1
Standard state (20 ^oC): gas

Discovery: 1868 Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen (FR); Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer (GB)

Helium was discovered by Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen (FR) and Sir Joseph Norman
Lockyer (GB) in 1868. The origin of the name comes from the Greek word 'helios'
meaning 'sun'. It is a light, odourless, colourless inert gas. Helium is the
second most abundant element in the universe. Helium is found in natural gas
deposits from wells in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. It is used in balloons, deep
sea diving and welding and in very low temperature research.
