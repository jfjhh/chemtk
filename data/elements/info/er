Discovery: 1843 Carl Gustav Mosander (SE)

Erbium was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander (SE) in 1843. Named after
'Ytterby', a village in Sweden. It is a soft, malleable, silvery metal that
reacts slowly with water and dissolves in acids. Metal ignites and burns
readily. Erbium is found with other heavier rare earths in xenotime and
euxenite. Erbium oxide is used in ceramics to obtain a pink glaze. There are
also a few uses in the nuclear industry and as an alloying agent for other
exotic metals.
