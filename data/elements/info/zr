Discovery: 1789 Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE)

Zirconium was discovered by Martin Heinrich Klaproth (DE) in 1789. The origin
of the name comes from the Arabic word 'zargun' meaning 'gold colour'. It is a
grey-white, lustrous, corrosion-resistant metal. Exposed surfaces form oxide
protective film. Zirconium is found in many minerals such as zircon and
baddeleyite. It is used in alloys such as zircaloy which is used in nuclear
applications since it does not readily absorb neutrons. Zirconium is used in
high-performance pumps and valves. Clear zircon (ZrSiO4) is a popular gemstone.
