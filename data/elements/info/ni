Discovery: 1751 Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (SE)

Nickel was discovered by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (SE) in 1751. The origin of the
name comes from the German word 'kupfernickel' meaning Devil's copper or St
Nicholas's (Old Nick's) copper. It is a hard, malleable, silvery-white metal.
Nickel is soluble in acids, resist alkalis. It can be polished to a lustrous
finish. It resists corrosion in air under normal conditions. Nickel is chiefly
found in pentlandite [(Ni,Fe)9S8] ore. The metal is produced by heating the ore
in a blast furnace which replaces the sulfur with oxygen. The oxides are then
treated with an acid that reacts with the iron not the nickel. Nickel is used
in electroplating and metal alloys because of its resistance to corrosion, in
nickel-cadmium batteries, and as a catalyst and for coins.
