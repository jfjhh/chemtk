Iron has been known since ancient times. The origin of the name comes from the
Latin word 'ferrum' meaning 'iron'. It is a malleable, ferromagnetic, ductile,
silvery-white metal. Exposed surfaces form red-brown oxides. Iron forms very
strong alloys (steel). Iron dust flammable. It's the Fourth most abundant
element in the earth's crust. Iron is obtained from iron ores. Pure metal is
produced in blast furnaces by layering limestone, coke and iron ore and forcing
hot gasses into the bottom. This heats the coke red hot and the iron is reduced
from its oxides and liquefied where it flows to the bottom. Iron is the most
common metal in human society. More than 90% of all metal refined in the world
is iron. It is used in steel and other alloys. Iron is the chief constituent of
hemoglobin which carries oxygen in blood vessels. It's oxides are used in
magnetic tapes and disks.
