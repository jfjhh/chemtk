Atomic number: 74
Group numbers: 6
Period: 6
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1783 Fausto Elhuyar, Juan Jose de Elhuyar (ES)

Tungsten was discovered by Fausto and Juan Jose de Elhuyar (ES) in 1783. Named
after the tungsten mineral 'wolframite'. It is a hard, steel-grey to white
metal that has the highest melting point of all metals. Tungesten resists
oxygen, acids and alkalis. Tungsten occurs in the minerals scheelite (CaWO4)
and wolframite [(Fe,Mn)WO4]. It is made into filaments for vacuum tubes and
electric lights it can also be used as contact points in cars. Tungsten carbide
is extremely hard and is used for making cutting tools and abrasives.
