Darmstadtium

Symbol:   Ds
Relative atomic mass: [281]
Atomic number: 110
Group numbers: 10
Period: 7
Standard state (20 ^oC): solid

Discovery: 1994 Sigurd Hofmann & GSI Darmstadt (DE)

Darmstadtium was discovered by S. Hofmann (DE) et al. collaboration at the
Heavy Ion Research Laboratory (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in
Darmstadt, Germany in November 1994. The title honours the Laboratory for Heavy
Ion Research (called GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, where the substance was first
made. It is a synthetic radioactive metal. The fusion evaporation reaction
using a 62Ni beam on an isotopically enriched 208Pb target produced four chains
of alpha-emitting nuclides following the presumed formation of 269110 + 1n.
