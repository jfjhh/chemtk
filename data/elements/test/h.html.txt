Discovery: 1766 Sir Henry Cavendish (GB)

Hydrogen was discovered by Sir Henry Cavendish (GB) in 1766. The origin of the
name comes from the Greek words 'hydro' and 'genes' meaning 'water' and
'generate'. It is a colourless, odourless gas which burns and forms explosive
mixtures in air and reacts violently with oxidants. Hydrogen is the most
abundant element in the universe. Commercial quantities of hydrogen are
produced by reacting superheated steam with methane or carbon. A laboratory
method for producing hydrogen is by the reaction of acids on metals such as
zinc or by the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used in the production
of ammonia and in metal refining. It is also used as fuel in rockets. Its two
heavier isotopes (deuterium and tritium) are used respectively for nuclear
fusion.
